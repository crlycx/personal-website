        <h2>Hi</h2>

          <h3>Troubleshooting & Development</h3>
          <p>I was first introduced to coding through editing social media profiles. I picked it up quickly and was soon helping to edit my friends pages. I also have a knack for troubleshooting and have been able to research and solve most of the computer issues I have encountered entirely on my own. I'm often referred to as "tech support" in my office or with regular customers.</p>

          <span class="other-skills">
          <h3>Other things I enjoy</h3>
          <p>I love playing Ninteno Switch with my daughter. Right now, our favorite game is Mario Odyssey and we've almost collected all the power moons!<br>
          I also &hearts; love &hearts; to eat. My favorite meal is pasta, and I think it's importatnt to be able to cook my favorite dishes for myself so I have developed some great sauces from scratch. My best is a traditional meat sauce for spaghetti.</p>
